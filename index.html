<div class="bio">
    Adrienne Edwards: When I started to think about this show in 2018, I went to see a lot of Ailey performances. At one of them, a woman behind me was absolutely ecstatic in response to what she was watching. What I overheard made me wonder about the phenomenon that is the “Ailey experience” and, more precisely, about each of your first experiences with Ailey, whether it was with the man himself or with the company.

Brenda Dixon-Gottschild: This would have been in the early 1960s, at the beginning of the Ailey company. Their home base then was at the Clark Center, in the YWCA building at Eighth Avenue and Fifty-First Street, where I had been invited to present a dance I choreographed called “Lonely Woman,” in one of the center’s New Choreographers’ Concerts. So, I was back and forth to the Clark Center quite a bit, and what an experience it was to encounter the Ailey company. At the time, Ailey, Carmen de Lavallade, the glorious Thelma Hill, and Minnie Marshall were all dancing, and it was unlike any other company I had ever seen before as a young Black dancer—or really as a young anything dancer—–with its variety of body shapes and its groundedness, if you will. Back then, both Mr. Ailey and Thelma were performing with the ensemble, and in general, the dancing bodies of the 1960s were less streamlined, athletic, and balletic than they are now. The mere fact of the company’s existence offered a justification for the fact that I dance and I exist, and that there is a concert stage for people like us.
